1. What is PoDoFo?
==================

PoDoFo is a library to work with the PDF file format and includes also a few
tools. The name comes from the first letter of PDF (Portable Document
Format). 

The PoDoFo library is a free portable C++ library which includes
classes to parse a PDF file and modify its contents into memory. The changes
can be written back to disk easily. The parser could also be used to write a
PDF viewer. Besides parsing PoDoFo includes also very simple classes to create
your own PDF files. All classes are documented so it is easy to start writing
your own application using PoDoFo.

The PoDoFo tools are simple tools build around the PoDoFo library. These tools
are first of all examples on how to use the PoDoFo library in your own
projects. But secondly they offer also features for working with PDF
files. More tools will come with future release and the existing tools will
gain more features. The following tools are currently available: 
* podofoimgextract (which extracts all jpeg images from a given PDF file) 
* podofouncompress (which removes all compression filters from a PDF file - this is useful for debugging
existing PDF files).
* podofopdfinfo (provides some basic info about a PDF - metadata, page details, etc.)
* podofotxt2pdf (converts a text file to a PDF)

Additionally there is the external tool PoDoFoBrowser which is not included in
this package, but can be downloaded from the PoDoFo webpage. PoDoFoBrowser is
a Qt application for browsing the objects in a PDF file and modifying their
keys easily. It is very useful if you want to look on the internal structure
of PDF files.

As of now PoDoFo is available for Unix, Mac OS X and Windows platforms. 

2. Where can I can get it?
==========================

PoDoFo is available on the internet: podofo.sf.net

3. Requirements
===============

To build PoDoFo lib you need besides a working GNU toolchain (Unix) and a c++
compiler or Visual Studio 7.x (Windows) as well as the following libraries:

- fontconfig (Unix only)
- freetype2
- zlib
- libjpeg

4. Installation
===============

PoDoFo can be installed and build using CMake. The autotools build was dropped
as maintaining two build systems consumes a lot of resources which
can be spend better on improving PoDoFo itself.

On Windows, it is recommended that you use CMake to generate Visual Studio
project files appropriate for your VS version and your libraries. You can also
generate NMake builds or MinGW Makefiles (see "Installation with CMake").
Alternately, Windows users can use the provided Visual Studio Solution/Project
files after placing the other libraries in a directory inside of the podofo
directory.

An XCode project is provided for Mac OS X users, or you can generate one to fit
your local configuration and libraries using CMake.

4.1 Installation with CMake
===========================

PoDoFo has support for builds using CMake on all supported
platforms. The CMake build has been tested on:

	- Visual C++ 8 Express Edition [Win32] ("Visual Studio 8 2005" target)
	- Visual C++ 8 Express +NMake [Win32] ("NMake Makefiles" target)
	- MinGW with GCC 3.4.2 [Win32] ("MinGW Makefiles" target)
	- gcc 3.3.5 [Linux: Debian 3.1] ("Unix Makefiles" target)
	- gcc 4.0 [Linux: Debian 4.0] ("Unix Makefiles" target)
	- gcc 4.1 [Linux: Debian 4.0] ("Unix Makefiles" target)
	- gcc 4.0 [Mac OS X 10.4.10] ("Unix Makefiles" target)

You can use the CMake variable CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to control the type of
build. The main values supported are DEBUG and RELEASE. The default is
DEBUG. Set the build type with the CMake argument:
	-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG
		or
	-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE
as appropriate.

You can control where the files are installed with `make install' with
	-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/dir

All instructons below use out-of-tree builds (recommended). To clean up an
out-of-tree build, just delete the build directory, as no files are touched
within the source directory.

On all Makefile-style builds, set the VERBOSE flag to 1 on the make command
line to see all compiler commands etc, eg:

4.1.1 CMake builds on Linux/UNIX
================================

Linux and UNIX users should be able to build PoDoFo by cd'ing into the PoDoFo
checkout or unpacked tarball directory (here assumed to be named "podofo-src")
then running the build commands shown below. The CMake command below will
install into $HOME/podofo to avoid needing root priveleges for installation,
but you can change the destination to wherever you want or remove the install
prefix setting to use the default.

To build and install:

mkdir ../podofo-build
cd ../podofo-build
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$HOME/podofo" ../podofo-src
make
make install

To see detailed compiler output, use:

make VERBOSE=1

instead of just "make".

If you need to specify additional paths to search for libraries, set the
CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH and CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables or set them on
the command line:

cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ../podofo-src \
	-DCMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/sfw/include \
	-DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/sfw/lib

If you wish to generate only a static library or only a shared library, set the
PODOFO_BUILD_SHARED and/or PODOFO_BUILD_STATIC flags:

cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ../podofo-src \
	-DCMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/sfw/include \
	-DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/sfw/lib \
	-DPODOFO_BUILD_SHARED=TRUE \
	-DPODOFO_BUILD_STATIC=FALSE

By default, all supported library types will be built where possible (with older
CMake versions you might need to build either the static or shared library,
not both).

Note that the instructions above run an out-of-tree build. CMake does support
in-tree builds, but the use of out-of-tree builds is very strongly recommended.

If your system has gcc 4, PoDoFo will tell gcc to make symbols hidden by
default using the -fvisibility=hidden flag to gcc. Only symbols explicitly
exported by PoDoFo will be exported. You can explicitly enable or disable this
behaviour with the boolean flag:
    -DPODOFO_USE_VISIBILITY=1 (or 0 for off).
Enabling default hidden visibility reduces the PoDoFo binary size dramatically
and improves link times. It also helps prevent accidental use of symbols that
are not part of PoDoFo's public API. PoDoFo developers will also find this
useful, as it will cause some mistakes to be reported as link errors that would
otherwise go undetected and break the win32 builds.

4.1.2 CMake builds on Mac OS X
==============================

Mac OS X users can build PoDoFo using CMake either by generating conventional
UNIX Makefiles (the  "Unix Makefiles" CMake target) or generating an XCode
project (the "Xcode" target). In either case the following applies.

You will need freetype and fontconfig. It's possible to omit the use of
libjpeg (see the platform-independent documentation) but by default libjpeg
will also be required. If you have these libraries already (say, from fink
or DarwinPorts) you can skip the following section and update the
CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH and CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH arguments appropriately.

 Dependencies
 -----------

I'll assume you're installing podofo and any required libraries into $HOME/libs
. Adjust to taste, but keep it consistent.

You can get libjpeg from:
	http://www.ijg.org/files/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz
Unpack the tarball and cd into the resulting directory in the Terminal, then run:
	cp /usr/share/libtool/config.{sub,guess} .
to update the configure files. Now run:
	./configure --enable-shared --prefix $HOME/libs
	make
	make install

You might have to run:
	mkdir -p $HOME/libs/{bin,lib,man/man1,include}
to get install to work.

Next: freetype. You can get the latest freetype sources from freetype.org. Download
them and unpack the tarball, then cd into it in Terminal and run:
	./configure --prefix=$HOME/libs
	make 
	make install

fontconfig is a little trickier. It requires the expat library. Get it from
	http://sf.net/projects/expat
then unpack the source tarball and cd into it in Terminal. Run:
	./configure --prefix=$HOME/libs
	make 
	make install
	
Now we build fontconfig its self. Get the current fontconfig sources from:
	http://freedesktop.org/fontconfig/release/
and then unpack the source tarball and cd into it in Terminal. Run:
	./configure --prefix=$HOME/libs --with-freetype-config=/Users/post/libs/bin/freetype-config --with-expat=$HOME/libs
	make
	make install

 PoDoFo its self
 ---------------

You should be able to configure and install podofo on Mac OS X using:

	cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" \
		-DWANT_FONTCONFIG:BOOL=TRUE \
		-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/libs \
		-DCMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=/Users/post/libs/include/ \
		-DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=/Users/post/libs/lib \
		../podofo
	make
	make install

change "Unix Makefiles" to "Xcode" if you want to build an XCode project instead, then
instead of running `make' and `make install' just open the project file and work as normal

4.1.3 CMake builds on Windows
=============================

Building CMake on Windows can be done using MinGW (a minimalist gcc-based
compliler environment for Windows) or Visual Studio. Other methods may work but
have not been tested.

Because the C++ ABIs of most of the win32 compilers are incompatible, you must
build PoDoFo with the same compiler and version that you will use to build the
programs linked to PoDoFo. Failure to follow this restriction will result in
link errors at best, and bizarre runtime failures at worst.

On Windows, if you are linking against a shared (DLL) build of PoDoFo you MUST
define the preprocessor macro USING_SHARED_PODOFO when including any podofo
headers. Failure to do so will result in link time and/or runtime errors.
Similarly, defining it when linking with a static PoDoFo can cause problems.

On Windows, PoDoFo may be built as either a shared or static library. Building
both is not supported. By default only the shared library will be built. If you
want a static library, just disable generation of the shared library with the
extra argument to cmake:

	-DPODOFO_BUILD_SHARED=FALSE

4.1.3.1 CMake builds on Windows with MinGW
==========================================

MinGW builds are essentially the same as the UNIX instructions above, but
Windows-style paths should be used. Make sure that the MinGW "bin"
directory is on your PATH, and be sure to set CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH and
CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH such that CMake can find the headers and libraries that
PoDoFo requires. The GnuWin32 library packages from http://gnuwin32.sf.net/
are known to work.

md ..\podofo-debug
cd ..\podofo-debug
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..\podofo-src -DCMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=c:\progra~1\gnuwin32\include -DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=c:\progra~1\gnuwin32\lib
mingw32-make

One of the easiest ways to get MinGW is as part of the Qt4 package from
Trolltech.

It is extremely strongly recommended that you build PoDoFo only as a static
library if you are using MinGW. libstdc++ on MinGW at the time of writing was
not a shared library, causing serious issues with memory allocation and
deallocation when C++ objects are passed by value across DLL boundaries or are
otherwise deleted in a different DLL to where they were allocated. Of course,
this will cause you problems if you intend to use PoDoFo across DLL boundaries,
but until libstd++ is made shared on MinGW there's not much to be done. VC++
does not suffer from this issue.

4.1.3.1 CMake builds on Windows with Visual Studio
==================================================

A Visual Studio build requires that Microsoft Visual Studio be installed.
Visual Studio 8 2005 Express Edition is known to work, and is a free download
from Microsoft. The visual studio build has two stages - first, CMake is used
to generate a Visual Studio solution:

md ..\podofo-debug
cd ..\podofo-debug
cmake -G "Visual Studio 8 2005" ..\podofo-src -DCMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=c:\progra~1\gnuwin32\include -DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=c:\progra~1\gnuwin32\lib
podofo.sln

... and build the solution when it opens in Visual Studio.

Note that CMake should automatically find your Visual Studio install, so you
shouldn't need any special settings unless you have an unusual setup or more
than one version of Visual Studio installed.

You can get the Visual C++ Express Edition from
http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/ .
You will need to install the Win32 SDK if using the Express Edition, since it
is not bundled.

4.1.3.1 CMake builds on Windows with NMake
==========================================

PoDoFo can also be built with NMake. The build procedure is essentially the same
as described for MinGW or Visual Studio, but you must use the target name
"NMake Makefiles" and run "nmake" after CMake completes.

Getting your environment set up correctly for NMake can be tricky in some
environments. The author of this section is a bit of a newbie with these tools,
but has had success running the Windows 2003 SDK environment file first,
followed by the Visual Studio vcvars.bat file. If something goes wrong clean
your build directory before trying again.
